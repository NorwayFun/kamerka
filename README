Kamerka - take photos using your webcam and shiny animated QML interface.

Kamerka is a Qt5 app that uses KF5 libraries. It uses Video4Linux to get
images from a webcam and is able to save photos. The interface is based
on QML and uses its possibilities to show an easy-to-use animated UI.

Note:
You need to have QImageBlitz built with Qt5. Most distributions provide
it only in Qt4 version.

You can get it from svn repo:
  svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/kdesupport/qimageblitz
